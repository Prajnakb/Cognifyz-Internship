# **🍽️ Data Science Internship - Restaurant Data Analysis**
## **🚀 Internship by Cognifyz Technologies
### Where Data Meets Intelligence**

## **📌 Overview**
This repository showcases the tasks and insights derived from my Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The primary focus of this project was to analyze restaurant data through various data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques.

## **💾 Dataset**
The dataset included various attributes such as:
📍 Location Information: City, Country, Latitude, Longitude
🍽️ Restaurant Details: Cuisines, Price Range, Online Delivery, Table booking
⭐ Ratings & Votes: Aggregate Rating, Rating Color, and Votes

## **🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used**
**Programming & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Folium)
**Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
**Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
**Version Control:** Git and GitHub

## **🗂️ Work Completed**
### **🔹 Level 1: Data Exploration & Preprocessing**

**✅ Task 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning**
Explored dataset: Identified number of rows & columns
Checked & handled missing values
Converted data types & analyzed class imbalances in aggregate ratings

**✅ Task 2: Descriptive Analysis**
Calculated mean, median, standard deviation for numerical columns
Explored distribution of categorical variables (City, Country, Cuisines)
Identified top cuisines & cities with most restaurants

**✅ Task 3: Geospatial Analysis**
Mapped restaurant locations using latitude & longitude (Folium)
Analyzed restaurant distribution across cities & countries
Checked correlation between location & ratings

### **🔹 Level 2: Advanced Data Analysis**

**✅ Task 1: Table Booking & Online Delivery Analysis**
Analyzed % of restaurants offering table booking & online delivery
Compared average ratings of restaurants with & without table booking
Examined online delivery availability by price range

**✅ Task 2: Price Range Analysis**
Identified most common price range
Calculated average ratings per price range
Determined rating color associated with highest ratings

**✅ Task 3: Feature Engineering**
Extracted new features (length of restaurant name & address)
Encoded categorical features: Table Booking & Online Delivery

### **🔹 Level 3: Machine Learning & Visualization**

**✅ Task 1: Predictive Modeling**
Built Regression Models to predict Aggregate Ratings
Trained & tested models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, R² Score

**✅ Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis**
Analyzed relationship between cuisine types & ratings
Identified most popular cuisines based on votes
Found high-rated cuisines

**✅ Task 3: Data Visualization**
Created histograms & bar charts to visualize rating distribution
Compared average ratings of cuisines & cities
Analyzed relationships between features & target variable

## **📊 Visualizations & Insights**
Visualizations were crafted using tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium, providing actionable insights into trends within the restaurant industry.

## **🎯 Conclusion**
This project offered deep insights into the restaurant industry by analyzing ratings, customer preferences, and pricing patterns. Predictive models further provided the ability to forecast ratings based on restaurant features.

## **📌 Key Takeaways:**
✔️ Data preprocessing is essential for accurate analysis.
✔️ Some cuisines and price ranges are more popular and receive better ratings.
✔️ Features like location and online delivery availability significantly affect ratings.
✔️ Machine learning models effectively predict restaurant ratings.
